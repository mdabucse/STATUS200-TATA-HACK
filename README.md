# Traffic Signs Detection and Classification in Real-Time

### New Version Coming Soon: SSD-Based Detection for Higher Accuracy
A new version of the system using **SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector)** will be released this summer to provide better accuracy in traffic sign detection. Stay tuned for updates!

## 1. Description
This project implements a **traffic sign detection and classification system** using **OpenCV** on videos. It detects traffic signs, classifies them using a pre-trained **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** model, and tracks detected signs in real-time.

### Detection Phase:
The detection process uses various **image processing techniques** to identify potential traffic signs:
1. **Increase the contrast and dynamic range** of the video frame
2. **Remove unnecessary colors** (e.g., green) using HSV Color range
3. **Apply Laplacian of Gaussian** to display object borders
4. **Make contours** using Binarization
5. **Detect ellipse-like and circle-like contours**

### Classification Phase:
The system crops detected signs from the frame and classifies them using a pre-trained SVM model. Each traffic sign is classified into one of the predefined classes. The system supports the following traffic sign classes:
- **Class 0**: Non-traffic signs
- **Classes 1-7**: Specific traffic signs
- **Class 8 and above**: Categorized as **OTHERS**

The **biggest** sign in the frame is selected and classified. The SVM model is retrained each time the program runs and saved as `[data_svm.dat](data_svm.dat)` for future use.

If a traffic sign is detected, it will be tracked until it disappears or a larger sign appears in the frame. The tracking is done using **Dense Optical Flow**.

## 2. Prerequisites:
- Python 3.5
- [OpenCV 3](https://opencv.org/)
- Imutils (`pip3 install imutils`)

## 3. System Structure

### a. Python Modules:
- `[main.py](main.py)`: The main entry point of the program.
- `[classification.py](classification.py)`: SVM Model for classifying traffic signs.
- `[common.py](common.py)`: Functions to define the SVM Model.

Other files:
- `[data_svm.dat](data_svm.dat)`: Saved SVM model after training.
- `[README.md](README.md)`: Documentation file (this file).

### b. Dataset:
The `[Dataset](dataset)` folder contains images for training the SVM model. There are 12 folders corresponding to the different classes of traffic signs. Folder **0** contains non-traffic sign images.

The dataset is generated by running the detection phase on several videos, and the resulting cropped images are manually sorted into appropriate classes.

The dataset can be updated by reviewing all the cropped images of detected signs and correcting misclassifications.

## 4. Installation

To run the program, you can either use default or custom arguments:

### Default Arguments:
```bash
$ python3 main.py
